# Geo-Smart PriceBot

Geo-Smart PriceBot is an interactive Streamlit chatbot app that lets users compare simulated grocery prices across multiple countries and supermarkets. Ask natural-language questions like:

-- Compare milk in India  
-- What's the price of eggs in Germany?  
-- Find cheapest oil in USA
It uses fuzzy matching to handle spelling or singular/plural variations, and displays results in a beautiful, responsive layout.
